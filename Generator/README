
                           The Salsa Binding Generator

  Generates Haskell modules (called 'Bindings' and 'Labels') that together
  contain the binding code required to interface with specific .NET classes and
  their members.  An import file provides a list of the classes and their
  assemblies.

Usage:

  Generator.exe Project.imports

  where 'Project.imports' is a file that lists (on separate lines):

    * The classes to import (optionally followed by a comma-separated list of
      the members from the class to import).  For example:

      System.Environment                  (binds all members of the Environment
                                           class)

      System.Console: Write, WriteLine    (binds only the Write and WriteLine
                                           methods of the Console class)

    * The assemblies that hold the imported classes.  For example:

      reference C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\System.dll

      (to make a reference to the .NET 2.0 System assembly)

Building:

  Run 'msbuild' in the 'Generator' directory.
